AVFoundation AVMutableComposition example of merging into one video. One video is overlay another one with both opacity 0.5, the output video duration will be longer duration in input videos
Original tutorial is taken from here : https://www.raywenderlich.com/5135-how-to-play-record-and-merge-videos-in-ios-and-swift
it concats one video to the end of another one. But in this repository I added them as overlay.
